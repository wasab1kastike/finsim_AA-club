# FinSim
A cozy 4X idle/autobattler inspired by Finnish history and the *sisu* spirit. Build, vibe, and let quiet power reshape the map.

## âœ¨ Vision (1-paragraph)
Grow a settlement into a resilient nation by making calm choices that compound over time. Economy idles forward, armies auto-skirmish on 3 lanes, and your **Sisu** meter fuels clutch plays. Playful homage to the Kekkonen era; respectful, non-literal.

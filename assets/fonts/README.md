This directory should contain font files used by the project.

To keep the repository lightweight and avoid storing binary assets,
acquire the following fonts separately and place them in this folder:

- `OpenSans-Regular.ttf`
- `PressStart2P-Regular.ttf`

Fonts can be downloaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
or other reliable sources.

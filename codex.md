For a feature overview and setup instructions, see the [README](README.md).

## World Map
- The world is built on a hexagonal grid.
- Tiles can hold resources, player structures, or PvE encounters.

## Combat
- Battles run as an autobattler: units act automatically without lanes.
- Each unit seeks and attacks the closest enemy unit on the field.
- When no enemy units remain, units target nearby PvE monsters or event entities.

## Design Direction
- Emphasis on free positioning and proximity-based targeting rather than fixed lanes.
- This document reflects the shift away from lane-based combat to a more dynamic hex-grid autobattler system.
